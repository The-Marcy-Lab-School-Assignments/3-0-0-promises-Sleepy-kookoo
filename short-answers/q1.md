# Question
Consider the following code:

```js
Promise.resolve('Inside promise').then(console.log);
console.log('Outside promise')
```

Which prints first: `Inside promise` or `Outside promise`. More importantly, can you explain why?

# Answer
    The 'outside promise' will print out first because it is an synchronous operation. While 'inside promise' is an asynchronous operation called a promise which need something to happen first before it runs. 

# Teacher Feedback

The reason why outside promise will run first is because JS will always run synchronous code first.
