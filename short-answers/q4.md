# Question
with `new Promise((resolve, reject) => {...})`, what do the arguments that you pass into `resolve/reject` do?

    The arguments we pass into resolve is `.then()` and 
    reject is `.catch()'.

# Teacher Feedback

You are correct with this association however your wording could be improved. The value of resolve can be seen in a then block whereas the values of reject will be found in the catch block!
