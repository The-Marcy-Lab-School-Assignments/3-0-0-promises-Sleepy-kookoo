# Question
What is the difference between `.then` and `.catch`? What are the similarities?

# Answer
    The difference between '.then' and '.catch' are then is getting a reward while catch signifies it was wrong. They are similar because we use both when we are creating promises and they work together to make sure the code runs smoothly. 

# Teacher Feedback

So close, they are similar because they both take in a callback function!
